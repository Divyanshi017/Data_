# ## Exercise: Python for loop
# 1. After flipping a coin 10 times you got this result,
# ```
# result = ["heads","tails","tails","heads","tails","heads","heads","tails","tails","tails"]
# ```
# Using for loop figure out how many times you got heads
result = ["heads","tails","tails","heads","tails","heads","heads","tails","tails","tails"]
c=0
for i in result:
    if i=="heads":
        c=c+1
print("count is",c)
